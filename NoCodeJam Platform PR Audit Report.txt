NoCodeJam Platform PR Audit Report
Executive Summary
Overall Status: 🛑 BLOCKERS FOUND Confidence Level: High Deployment Recommendation: Do NOT deploy until 
20260121_post_pr_full_FIXED.sql
 is applied.

Phase 1: Architecture & Foundations
Status: [✅ PASSED]
Findings: Foundational schema in 
20260116_core_schema.sql
 is solid. TypeScript types align perfectly with DB definitions.
Phase 2: Core Features
Status: [✅ PASSED]
Findings: Challenge and Pathway logic is sound. AI-generated content follows structural constraints.
Phase 3: UI/UX Quality
Status: [✅ PASSED]
Findings: Design system is consistently applied via 
index.css
. Navigation flows are logical.
Phase 4: AI Governance
Status: [✅ PASSED]
Findings: Skills and UI checklists effectively prevent AI from hallucinating XP values or requiring specific tools.
Phase 5: Performance & Scalability
Status: [❌ FAILED]
Critical Issues: 
LeaderboardPage.tsx
 has severe N+1 query overhead. 
PathwayDetail.tsx
 also has N+1 issues in module-challenge mapping.
Recommendation: Implement SQL Views for aggregation.
Phase 6: Security
Status: [⚠️ WARNINGS]
Findings: submissions table was missing from schema (now fixed in migration). Edge Functions are properly authenticated.
Phase 7: Deployment Readiness
Status: [❌ NOT READY]
Blocker: Original migration files contain syntax errors.
Fix: Use the newly created 
supabase/migrations/20260121_post_pr_full_FIXED.sql
.
Conclusion
The platform transformation is impressive, but structural SQL errors and performance N+1s are critical showstoppers. Apply the fixes in 
audit_report.md
 before merging.
