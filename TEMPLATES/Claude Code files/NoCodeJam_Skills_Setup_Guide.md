---

# NoCodeJam Pathway Generator

Generate compliant learning pathways following NoCodeJam templates.

## Core Rules

### XP Rules (CRITICAL)
- NEVER assign XP values
- NEVER estimate XP amounts
- ALWAYS use placeholder: `XP: (calculated by system)`
- System calculates XP based on difficulty + time + challenge count

### Tool Rules
- Tools are RECOMMENDED only, never required
- Use language: "recommended", "suggested", "works well with"
- Avoid: "must use", "requires", "only works with"
- Learners can substitute equivalent tools

### Image Rules
- Include placeholder: `Pathway Cover Image: [Description]`
- Do not generate actual images unless explicitly requested
- Provide clear description for future image generation

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Information

Ask these questions ONLY if not already provided:

1. "What should learners be able to do after completing this pathway?"
2. "What difficulty level: Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced?"
3. "How much time should this take to complete?"

Do not ask unnecessary questions. If the user has provided clear context, skip directly to generation.

### Step 2: Generate Pathway

Follow the pathway template in `references/pathway-template.md`.

Output structure:
1. Metadata (title, difficulty, time, tags)
2. Learning Objectives (3-5 clear outcomes)
3. Pathway Structure (sequence of learning phases)
4. Challenges (ordered sequence with descriptions)
5. Reflection Prompts (evidence-focused questions)
6. Image Placeholder
7. XP Placeholder

### Step 3: Validate Output

Before presenting to user, verify:
- [ ] All template sections included
- [ ] XP shows placeholder only (no numbers)
- [ ] Tools use "recommended" language
- [ ] Image placeholder present
- [ ] Difficulty matches complexity
- [ ] Time estimate is realistic

### Step 4: Present

Add this header to output:

```

Template Version: v1
Validation: [PASSED/FAILED]
```

## Template Reference

See `references/pathway-template.md` for complete structure.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Assigning XP values (e.g., "XP: 100")
✅ Using placeholder (e.g., "XP: (calculated by system)")

❌ "This challenge requires Figma"
✅ "This challenge works well with Figma or similar design tools"

❌ Missing reflection prompts
✅ Including 3-4 evidence-focused reflection questions

❌ Overly ambitious scope for time box
✅ Realistic scope that respects time constraint

## Examples

### Good Pathway Output

```

```

### Bad Pathway Output

```
# Advanced ML Engineering

**XP:** 500 points  ❌ (AI assigned XP)
**Time:** 3 days  ❌ (Too short for "Advanced")

## What You'll Learn
- Everything about machine learning  ❌ (Too vague)

## Tools Required  ❌ (Tools are "required")
- You must use TensorFlow  ❌ (Specific tool required)
- Python 3.9 or higher required  ❌ (Overly specific)

## Challenges
1. Build a neural network  ❌ (No context or guidance)
```

## Troubleshooting

**Issue:** User asks for XP value
**Response:** "XP is calculated by the system based on difficulty, time estimate, and number of challenges. I can include a placeholder in the pathway, but the actual XP value will be determined when you publish the pathway."

**Issue:** User insists on specific tool requirement
**Response:** "NoCodeJam's philosophy is tool-agnostic learning. I can strongly recommend a tool and explain why it's ideal, but learners should be able to substitute equivalent tools. Would you like me to rewrite the tool reference as a recommendation?"

**Issue:** Pathway scope doesn't fit time box
**Response:** "The current pathway would take approximately [X] hours, but your time box is [Y] hours. I recommend either: (1) reducing scope by removing [specific content], or (2) extending the time estimate to [realistic time]. Which would you prefer?"
```

### Create references/pathway-template.md

Create `.claude/skills/nocodejam-pathway/references/pathway-template.md`:

```markdown
# Learning Pathway Template

This is the canonical template for all NoCodeJam learning pathways.

## Required Sections (in order)

### 1. Metadata
```
# [Pathway Title]

**Difficulty:** [Beginner | Intermediate | Advanced]
**Time Estimate:** [X weeks/days (Y-Z hours)]
**XP:** (calculated by system)
**Tags:** [tag1, tag2, tag3]
**Pathway Cover Image:** [Description of image]
```

### 2. Learning Objectives

3-5 measurable outcomes starting with action verbs.

```
## Learning Objectives
By completing this pathway, you will be able to:
- [Action verb] [specific skill/knowledge]
- [Action verb] [specific skill/knowledge]
- [Action verb] [specific skill/knowledge]
```

Examples of good action verbs:
- Build, Create, Design, Implement
- Analyze, Evaluate, Debug, Troubleshoot  
- Deploy, Configure, Optimize, Refactor

### 3. Pathway Structure

Organized into phases with time estimates.

```
## Pathway Structure

### Phase 1: [Phase Name] ([Time estimate])
[Brief description of what learners will do in this phase]

**Challenges:**
1. [Challenge Name]
2. [Challenge Name]

### Phase 2: [Phase Name] ([Time estimate])
[Brief description]

**Challenges:**
3. [Challenge Name]
4. [Challenge Name]
```

### 4. Challenge Sequence

Brief description of each challenge in order.

```
## Challenges

### 1. [Challenge Name]
**Difficulty:** [Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced]
**Time:** [X hours]

[1-2 sentence description of what learner will do]

**Recommended Tools:** [Tool 1], [Tool 2] or similar
```

### 5. Reflection Prompts

Evidence-focused questions (not vague feelings).

```
## Reflection Prompts

1. [Question asking for specific evidence of learning]
2. [Question asking learner to show their work]
3. [Question asking learner to apply knowledge]
4. [Question about next steps or extensions]
```

Good reflection prompts:
- "Show evidence of [specific skill] in your project"
- "What specific line of code/design choice solved [problem]?"
- "How would you modify [something you built] to [new requirement]?"

Bad reflection prompts:
- "How did you feel about this pathway?" (too vague)
- "Did you learn a lot?" (not evidence-based)
- "What did you think?" (not specific)

### 6. Tools & Resources (Optional)

Only if specific tools are strongly recommended.

```
## Recommended Tools & Resources

**Design:** Figma, Sketch, or similar design tools
**Code:** VS Code, Sublime Text, or any code editor
**Reference:** [Link to documentation]

Note: These are recommendations. Learners may use equivalent tools.
```

### Create references/xp-rules.md

Create `.claude/skills/nocodejam-governance/references/xp-rules.md`:

```markdown
# XP Rules

## Absolute Rules

1. **Never Assign XP Values**
   - AI cannot estimate XP
   - AI cannot calculate XP
   - AI cannot suggest XP ranges

2. **Always Use Placeholder**
   - Exact text: `XP: (calculated by system)`
   - No variations allowed
   - No explanations needed

3. **System Calculates XP**
   - Based on difficulty level
   - Based on time estimate
   - Based on challenge count
   - Formula is proprietary to NoCodeJam

## Why These Rules Exist

- XP is a platform-wide currency
- Consistency is critical for fairness
- AI cannot know the full XP economy
- Only the system has complete context

## Violations to Flag

❌ "XP: 100"
❌ "XP: 50-100 points"
❌ "Approximately 75 XP"
❌ "This should be worth about 100 XP"
❌ "XP: TBD" (use placeholder instead)

✅ "XP: (calculated by system)"

## Response to XP Questions

If user asks about XP values:

"XP is calculated by the NoCodeJam system based on difficulty, time estimate, and challenge count. I've included the placeholder 'XP: (calculated by system)' which will be replaced with the actual value when you publish the content. The system ensures fair and consistent XP across all content."
```

### Create references/tool-policy.md

Create `.claude/skills/nocodejam-governance/references/tool-policy.md`:

```markdown
# Tool Recommendation Policy

## Core Philosophy

NoCodeJam is **tool-agnostic**. Learners should be able to complete challenges using equivalent tools of their choice.

## Policy Rules

### 1. Recommend, Don't Require

✅ DO:
- "This works well with Figma, Sketch, or similar design tools"
- "Recommended: VS Code or any code editor"
- "Suggested platform: Netlify, Vercel, or equivalent"

❌ DON'T:
- "You must use Figma"
- "This requires Node.js 16.0 exactly"
- "Only works with Chrome"

### 2. Provide Alternatives

When recommending tools, offer options:
- "VS Code, Sublime Text, or any text editor"
- "Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, or similar"
- "Notion, Trello, Asana, or equivalent"

### 3. Explain Why

When recommending a tool, explain the benefit:
- "Figma is recommended because it's free and collaborative, but any design tool with prototyping will work"
- "VS Code is suggested for its built-in terminal, but any editor is fine"

### 4. Version Flexibility

Avoid exact version requirements:
- ✅ "Node.js 14 or higher"
- ❌ "Node.js 16.4.2 exactly"

### 5. Platform Agnostic

Don't require specific operating systems:
- ✅ "Works on Windows, Mac, or Linux"
- ❌ "Mac only"

## Language Guide

### Acceptable
- "recommended"
- "suggested"
- "works well with"
- "designed for"
- "optimized for"
- "or similar"
- "or equivalent"

### Unacceptable
- "must use"
- "requires"
- "only works with"
- "you need"
- "mandatory"
- "necessary"

## Exception: True Technical Requirements

## Using the Skills in Claude Code

### Option 1: Manual Skill Loading

When you need a skill, explicitly reference it:

```
User: "I need to create a learning pathway for web development"

You (in Claude Code): "I'll use the nocodejam-pathway skill to generate this. Let me read the skill first."

[Use view tool to read .claude/skills/nocodejam-pathway/SKILL.md]
[Generate pathway following skill instructions]
[Use nocodejam-governance skill to validate]
[Present final output]
```

### Option 2: Automatic Skill Detection

Claude Code can automatically detect when to use skills based on the descriptions. Make sure your skill descriptions are clear and comprehensive.

### Option 3: Project Configuration

Create `.claude/config.yaml` in your project root:

```yaml
skills:
  - path: .claude/skills/nocodejam-pathway
    auto_load: true
  - path: .claude/skills/nocodejam-challenge
    auto_load: true
  - path: .claude/skills/nocodejam-governance
    auto_load: true

governance:
  enforce_validation: true
  require_templates: true
```

---

## Testing Your Skills

### Test 1: Pathway Generation

```bash
# In Claude Code, try:
"Create a beginner pathway for learning JavaScript in 2 weeks"

# Expected behavior:
# 1. Loads nocodejam-pathway skill
# 2. Asks clarifying questions (if needed)
# 3. Generates pathway following template
# 4. Validates with governance skill
# 5. Presents validated output
```

### Test 2: Challenge Generation

```bash
# Try:
"Generate a challenge for building a to-do list app"

# Expected behavior:
# 1. Loads nocodejam-challenge skill
# 2. Follows challenge template
# 3. Uses recommended tool language
# 4. Validates before presenting
```

### Test 3: Governance Enforcement

```bash
# Try to break the rules:
"Create a pathway with 500 XP that requires VS Code"

# Expected behavior:
# 1. Generates content
# 2. Governance validation FAILS
# 3. Reports violations
# 4. Suggests fixes
# 5. Regenerates correctly
```
