Purpose
This directory contains all authoritative content templates used across the NoCodeJam platform. These templates define the minimum structure, required fields, and quality expectations for platform content.

Why templates matter
Templates convert informal expectations into repeatable, auditable standards. They ensure:

Consistent structure across challenges and learning pathways

Reduced rework during moderation

Clear guidance for both human contributors and AI-assisted drafting

Alignment with governance, accessibility, and academic integrity requirements

What belongs here

Challenge templates (V2 / Final)

Learning pathway templates

PRD / SRS templates

Moderation and review templates

Any document used as a source of truth for content structure

Usage rules

Templates in this folder are normative (they define the standard)

Any AI output must conform to the latest template version

Changes to templates should be versioned and reviewed before adoption

Versioning
Templates are versioned explicitly (e.g. v2, final) to preserve auditability and allow controlled evolution of standards over time.
