Purpose
This directory contains custom AI skills used to support NoCodeJam workflows in a governed, reusable, and auditable way.

These are not free-form prompts. They are constrained AI capabilities designed to enforce platform rules.

Why skills exist
Skills were created to solve three core problems:

Prevent AI from breaking templates

Ensure outputs are reviewable and consistent

Reduce token waste and hallucinated structure

What’s inside
Each skill directory typically includes:

SKILL.md — skill purpose, constraints, and validation logic

Embedded reference templates

Example inputs and outputs

Clear scope boundaries (what the skill can and cannot do)

Examples of skills

Pathway generation with enforced structure

Challenge drafting with mandatory fields

Governance checks against approved templates

Governance principles

Skills are reusable, versioned components

Skills enforce structure — humans retain judgment

Skills never bypass moderation or approval workflows
